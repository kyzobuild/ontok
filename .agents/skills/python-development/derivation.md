# Derivation

## Definition

A fact that is a pure function of a frozen value's already-proven fields, written on the model that owns them. It takes only `self`, its body is one returned expression, and it returns a declared type, model, or union. The same fields yield the same fact every time, because the value they compose never changes.

## Required form

```python
class Exposure(RootModel[Decimal], frozen=True):
    root: Decimal = Field(ge=0)


class Fill(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True, extra="forbid", from_attributes=True)
    order_id: OrderId
    account_id: AccountId
    fill_price: Price
    filled_quantity: Quantity

    @cached_property
    def exposure(self) -> Exposure:
        return Exposure(self.fill_price.root * self.filled_quantity.root)
```

`@property` and `@cached_property` return the same fact and differ only in substrate: `@property` recomputes it on each read, `@cached_property` computes it once and remembers. The choice is cost, never meaning: `@property` for a cheap fact (a constant, a single lookup), `@cached_property` when the fact is expensive, recursive, or read repeatedly, where the cache is what lets a recursion settle in one pass and a materialization happen once. `@computed_field` above `@cached_property` is the only one of the three that changes meaning: it writes the derived fact into every serialization, so it is used exactly when the fact is part of a contract shape.

Construction recurses, so a derivation over a recursive model reaches arbitrary depth with no loop: the comprehension inside the one returned expression is the whole traversal.

```python
class Portfolio(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True, extra="forbid")
    exposure: Exposure
    children: tuple["Portfolio", ...] = ()

    @cached_property
    def total_exposure(self) -> Exposure:
        return Exposure(self.exposure.root + sum(c.total_exposure.root for c in self.children))
```

The contract-shape form:

```python
class Quote(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True, extra="forbid")
    bid: Price
    ask: Price

    @computed_field
    @cached_property
    def mid(self) -> Price:
        return Price((self.bid.root + self.ask.root) / 2)
```

## The computation

A derivation is a function from the model's proven fields to the fact it returns: a proof that those fields imply that fact. The computation is determined meaning, not the builder's to invent: that exposure is price times quantity and not over it is a domain decision, made once where the model lives, never at build time. The operations that compose the proof are a closed algebra, the way the constructs are a closed set: arithmetic over the fields, a fold over a collection (the catamorphism that carries the one recursion), the extremum of a collection along a ranked closed value space (the same catamorphism choosing rather than summing), selection of an element by its key, and a lookup of a closed value through a total case table. A computation that needs an operation the algebra does not hold is a reported gap, never free code. The only part of a derivation the builder decides is cost, not meaning: whether the fact is recomputed on each read or memoized once.

## Query model

A question with an input is a composite fact: a frozen `BaseModel` holding the input and the value being queried, with the answer as a derivation on it, returning a constructed choice.

```python
class PriceQuery(BaseModel):
    model_config = ConfigDict(frozen=True, extra="forbid")
    book: PriceBook
    product: ProductId

    @cached_property
    def answer(self) -> PriceFound | PriceMissing:
        return next(
            (PriceFound(price=price) for key, price in self.book.root.items() if key == self.product),
            PriceMissing(product=self.product),
        )
```

## Sorting

- A fact implied by a frozen value's already-proven fields → this construct.
- A fact that differs by which union variant holds → each variant's own same-named derivation, read from the [union](union.md) value.
- A question with an input → the query model form, never a parameterized method.
- A state transition → a [verb](verb.md) on the [consistency model](consistency-model.md); a derivation stores nothing and changes nothing.
- A pure function of the model's own fields yields the value → a derivation, never also stored: a stored copy of a derivable fact is one meaning in two structures.
- No function of the fields can yield the value — it depends on the clock, a foreign read, a random source, or input the model does not keep → a field, computed once where the value is born and passed into construction. On `Quote`, `mid` is a derivation of `bid` and `ask`; the moment the quote was observed is a field.

## Allowed

- a derivation taking only `self`, body one returned expression, returning a declared type, model, or union
- `@property` to recompute a cheap fact, `@cached_property` to compute a costly, recursive, or repeatedly-read fact once, both pure over the fields
- `@computed_field` above `@cached_property` when the fact belongs to a contract's serialized shape
- a comprehension or generator expression inside the one returned expression
- the same-named derivation on every variant of a union, read from the union value
- a frozen query model holding the input and the queried value, its derivation returning the answer

## Forbidden

- a free function computing from a model's fields; a helper or utils entry
- a parameterized method on a frozen value
- a derivable field stored on a model
- a body that reads anything but the model's own fields (the clock, a client, a random source); a `@cached_property` freezes its first-read value and a `@property` returns a different value each call, so neither is a fact of the fields
- a derivation returning bare `bool`, `str`, or `int`; a `bool`-returning check is an undeclared union — a staleness check returns `Fresh | Stale`, each variant carrying its own facts
- a ternary, `and`, `or`, `match`, or private helper call inside the body
- serialization inside a derivation
