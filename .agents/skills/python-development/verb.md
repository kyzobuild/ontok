# Verb

## Definition

A state-transition method on the consistency model. Its parameter is the innermost constructed value it consumes; its body contains at most one construction statement, with constituents constructing inside that call; it may capture a foreign reply before the construction, re-point a state field to the constructed fact, and emit the constructed fact through a client field.

## Required form

```python
    def book(self, report: VenueFill) -> None:
        self.latest = Position(prior=self.latest, fill=report)
        self.bus.publish(self.latest)
        self.ledger.append(self.latest)
```

`Position.fill` is typed `Fill`, so the `Fill` constructs from the `VenueFill` inside the `Position` construction call. The state field is the constructed value's only name, and every emit passes the proven value itself. Serialization happens at the client binding or the route reply, never here.

A yielding verb yields constructed facts:

```python
    async def watch(self, account: AccountId) -> AsyncIterator[Fill]:
        async for report in self.feed.subscribe(account):
            yield Fill.model_validate(report)
```

A capturing verb feeds the [ordered union](ordered-union.md)'s constructor:

```python
    async def reconcile(self, account: AccountId) -> None:
        try:
            raw: object = await self.ledger.position(account)
        except PositionNotFoundError as signal:
            raw = signal
        self.recorded = LedgerReplyConstructor.validate_python(raw)
```

## Verb body

- At most one construction statement; constituent values construct inside that one call.
- The body may also: capture a foreign reply before the construction (one call assigned, each declared exception assigned to the same variable), assign the constructed fact to a state field, and emit the constructed fact through a client field.
- An effect is never emitted before the fact is constructed.
- A verb that constructs nothing, emits nothing, and yields nothing declares no transition.

## Replaced forms

- A multi-step body staging constructions in sequence is the work stolen from a constructor: a constituent constructed in a separate statement before the composite that holds it restates what the composite's call proves.
- A fetch-and-return method is a repository surface given a verb's name.
- Serialization in the body is the transport's concern restated in the domain.

## Sorting

- A fact implied by already-proven fields → a [derivation](derivation.md), not a verb.
- A method that only retrieves and returns → not a verb; consumers read facts that transitions establish.
- Construction of the request shape → the [route](route.md); the verb receives the innermost value, never a transport wrapper.
- Program placement → lives on the consistency model in `domain/<context>/[consistency_model].py`; see [topology](topology.md).

## Allowed

- `-> None` transition: at most one construction, a state-field assignment, emits of the proven fact
- the capture before the construction, exactly the three-line form, feeding the ordered union's constructor
- a yielding verb constructing and yielding one fact per arrival
- a returning verb whose return is read from the fact its body constructs

## Forbidden

- more than one construction statement in a body
- a constituent constructed in a separate statement before its composite
- `model_dump`, `model_dump_json`, or `.root` in the body
- a parameter holding a transport wrapper
- a method that only retrieves and returns
- `match`, `if`/`elif`, or `isinstance` in the body
- a hand-assembled dict where a constructed type belongs
- a stub body: `raise NotImplementedError`, bare `...`, or `pass`
